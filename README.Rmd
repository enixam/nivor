## Installation

You can install the released version of nivor from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("nivor")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

### AreaBump

```{r AreaBump, eval=FALSE}
data <- data.frame(
  year = 2000:2005,
  JavaScript = runif(6, min = 0, max = 50),
  ReasonML = runif(6, min = 0, max = 50),
  TypeScript = runif(6, min = 0, max = 50),
  Elm = runif(6, min = 0, max = 50),
  CoffeeScript = runif(6, min = 0, max = 50)
)

# the simplest use
n_area_bump(data)
```

### Calendar

```{r calendar, eval=FALSE}
library(nivor)

df <- data.frame(
  day = seq.Date(
    from = as.Date("2020-04-01"),
    length.out = 600,
    by = "days"
  ),
  value = round(runif(600) * 1000, 0)
)

# the simplest use
n_calendar(df)
```
